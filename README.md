# Go Tutorial

This is based off of the golang tutorial on "Tutorial: Create a Go Module"

Nothing too special, although I do find Go to be an interesting language from an initial look.

The link can be found here https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module

## How to use

All commands and usage can be found in the tutorial website, but basically perform the following.

1. Import Git repository and install go
2. Execute the following command to go into the hello directory with `cd hello/`
3. Run the following command `go run .`
4. To run tests, go to the `greetings/` directory and run `go test`
